</div>

### Description

Ever wanted to get feed back on something, like on if one of your programs are any good? Or just wanted to vote on something??? Well, now what i have created is a program that when customized to your liking, you can call a vote on a topic! Or on anything you like! Just set it up, and when you are ready, distribute the EXE to the users, and they will select an option that you have given them, and all the results are saved to a server, and so their are no messey connections, and best of all, it will display the results on a bar graph and how many votes have been made on all options. HAVE A GO! Their is already an EXE in this project to run as an example, fully working. Go on! Go vote NOW! :)
